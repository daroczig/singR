# singR: helper functions to "sing" songs with R

Initially created for [Code Poetry Slam 2.0](http://stanford.edu/~mkagen/codepoetryslam/), where I plan to tribute to the *KC & The Sunshine Band* for [Give It Up](http://www.metrolyrics.com/give-it-up-lyrics-kc-and-the-sunshine-band.html). Yes, this is a fun project -- but I'm happy to merge serious pull requests :)

## Installation

This will probably never end up on CRAN:

```r
devtools::install_github('daroczig/singR')
```

## POC pseudo-R code

The minimal version:

```r
while (TRUE)
    give_up(it)
```

The refrain of the classic "Give It Up" song:

```r
rep(NA, 11)
give_up(what = it, who = Baby)
give_up(what = it)
give_up(what = it, who = Baby)
rep(NA, 11)
give_up(what = it, who = Baby)
give_up(what = it)
give_up(what = it, who = Baby)
verify(give_up(what = it, who = you), times = 2)
give_up(what = it)
```

Some parts of the above pseudo-R script actually works, e.g. the "Na, na, na, na ..." part:

```r
> rep(NA, 11)
 [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
```

And we can also implement e.g. a minimal `give_up` function easily:

```r
give_up <- function(what, who = '')
	sprintf('%s give %s up', who, what)
```

## Working R code

After loading the `singR` package, the above psuedo-code should work:

```r
> library(singR)
> rep(NA, 11)
 [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
> give_up(what = it, who = Baby)
[1] "Baby give it up!"
> give_up(what = it)
[1] "Give it up!"
> give_up(what = it, who = Baby)
[1] "Baby give it up!"
> rep(NA, 11)
 [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
> give_up(what = it, who = Baby)
[1] "Baby give it up!"
> give_up(what = it)
[1] "Give it up!"
> give_up(what = it, who = Baby)
[1] "Baby give it up!"
> verify(give_up(what = it, who = you), times = 2)
[1] "Can you give it up?" "Can you give it up?"
> give_up(what = it)
[1] "Give it up!"
```

## Let R sing the song!

Building on the `koRpus` package, we can easily find all the syllables that can be written to the standard output in a timely manner:

```r
sing(
    capture.output(
        rep(NA, 11),
        give_up(what = it, who = Baby),
        give_up(what = it),
        give_up(what = it, who = Baby),
        rep(NA, 11),
        give_up(what = it, who = Baby),
        give_up(what = it),
        give_up(what = it, who = Baby),
        verify(give_up(what = it, who = you), times = 2),
        give_up(what = it)
    )
)
```

Resulting in:

## bringing rythms to life with tap.along()

Using the following note figures, accompany your rythms with lyrics and hear a beeping sound giving you the rythm:

- **w**  : whole note  
- **wd** : whole note, dotted  
- **h**  : half note  
- **hd** : half note, dotted  
- **q**  : quarter note  
- **qd** : quarter note, dotted  
- **e**  : eight note  
- **ed** : eight note, dotted  
- **t**  : triplet  
- **s**  : sixteenth note  

```r
heyjude <- list()
heyjude$lyrics <- c(rep(NA, 11), "Hey", "Hey","Jude")
heyjude$time.pattn <- "h, q, q, s, s, e, hd, s, s, e, h, s, ed, w"
heyjude$tempo <- 60
heyjude$repet <- 8 # I hesitated between this and "Inf"

do.call(what = tap.along, args = heyjude)
```

```
NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  Hey  Hey  Jude 
NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  Hey  Hey  Jude 
NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  Hey  Hey  Jude 
(ad infinitum)
```

## Future

But there's a lot more to do: my idea is to create a reference class for `it` with a function called `give` etc, which will end up in a beautiful, object-oriented R poetry! Or something else.
